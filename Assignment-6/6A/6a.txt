Assignment 6A: In class Javascript

This is a small assignment.  It requires you to do the following:

     Create an eclipse dynamic web project
    Download the servlets that we have provided and put them in the project
    Edit Config.java to give your database credentials
    Download the database ddl/dml that we have provided and, populate the tables
    Invoke the Login servlet from the Eclipse browser window to login
    Create a html page by editing the sample code below, to show a list of users (get it from the database), and on selecting a user, 
        invoke the conversationDetail servlet to get the messages for that user,
        parse the returned JSON using JSON.parse(this.responseText), and 
        display the contents in basic HTML format by assigning to document.getElementById().innerHTML as in the sample code below.
        NOTE:  create a complete well-formed HTML text before assigning to innerHTML.  If you do it piecewise, the browser thinks your HTML is malformed and does error correction (e.g. insert a table close tag which it thinks is missing).
    Open the html page, select the user and view the result for the user
        NOTE:  You can copy the URL from eclipse to a browser, so you can use browser javascript debugging tools
            The js console provided by your browser is *really* helpful in finding bugs.
            Also use the inspect function in your browser to view the DOM tree.  It's easy to find bugs in DOM tree construction by doing this.
    Submit the html page as your assignment submission. Any name for the file is fine, but you are welcome to append your roll number to it.
