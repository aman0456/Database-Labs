Just include the file Snippet.java and run on Spark with Java 8 and all the jar files.
First of all change the string variable called allFilesPath (the first line inside the main function) and enter the path of the directory where all files are present.

The directory should contain folder newsdata and all the relevant files (entities.txt, positive-words.txt, negative-words.txt).

Also make sure there is no directory named "output" in that directory.

After completion, there should be a directory named "output" in the main directory which will contain the required output files.
