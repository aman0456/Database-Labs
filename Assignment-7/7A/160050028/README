For showing the word count grouped by both source_name as well as the word, I concatenated the source name to every word in the article body and ran the code given in the WordCount.java to get the count and saved in the output directory.

So, basically if the source name is "foo" and say one of the word in the article body is "bar" then I create a new word "foo, bar" and store in a JavaRDD<String> then I run the code given in the WordCount.java to get the count.
